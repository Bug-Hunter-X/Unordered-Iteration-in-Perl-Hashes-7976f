This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Perl related to the unordered iteration of hash keys using a foreach loop.  The bug arises from the inherent nature of Perl hashes, which do not guarantee a specific order of keys. The solution shows how to maintain a specific order if needed, such as using an array of keys.
